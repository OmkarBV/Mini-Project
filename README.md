# Mini-Project

1. Mensuration 
  I developed a Java project that performs calculations related to mensuration concepts such as finding the area and perimeter of shapes like circles, squares, cones, rectangles, etc. The project takes user input for the dimensions of the desired shape, creates an instance of the appropriate shape class, and calculates the relevant measurements. It then displays the results to the user. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to solve problems related to mathematical concepts.
